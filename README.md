-This project was created for a friend of mine to promote his party planning and rental business!
-This was my introduction to web development and I had a lot of fun learning HTML, CSS, and JS for this project.
-I used Bootstrap 5 for front-end components and Javascript for a couple of animaitons. 

Here is the link for the website which I am hosting with Vercel:
